[EKG DDX](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ekg-ddx/id1483542588) is a [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) app that identifies potential EKG diagnostics using an algorithm developed by [Craig Hricz](https://www.wdhospital.org/wdh/providers/craig-r-hricz-pa-c). 

Craig needed someone who could help him build the app and publish it to iOS and Android app stores. In order to acheive this we made the app with [Expo](https://expo.io/), which is by far the fastest way to build an app using JavaScript. Here is what Craig had to say about the project:

> I had the pleasure of working with Jon on a smartphone app project over a period of several months. He was intuitive and was adept at taking my vision from something that existed as much in my mind as it did on paper. Jon was responsive during the ongoing creation and beta testing of the project and brought several good ideas to the table. The final result exceeded my expectations. <cite>â€”Craig Hricz</cite>
