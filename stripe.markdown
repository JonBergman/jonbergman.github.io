I’m Jon, a multi-disciplined creative that is passionate about building an inclusive web. There couldn’t be a better time to join Stripe. Brick and mortar shops are struggling to stay in business and there is an amazing opportunity to empower these entrepenuers to move business online. That is why I would love to join Stripe as a Designer. To work with amazing people to build products that allow entrepenuers to focus on their passion and keep their doors open.

## Why love me?

_I can do it all_. I have intentionally focused on becoming a generalist because I find delight in all aspects of the product development process. I take pride in using [both sides of my brain](https://www.healthline.com/health/left-brain-vs-right-brain#left-brainright-brain-theory), often wearing many different hats. I love solving complex business problems like the ROI of design. More specifically, I enjoy applying a [Lean UX](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/a-simple-introduction-to-lean-ux) process to ideate, test, and validate ideas. Then, I use my knowledge of software engineering to build [accessible](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/), scalable, and beautiful user interfaces with code.

_I am self-motivated_. I ask hard questions, and with determination, find the answers. If I make a mistake-I own it, fix it, and grow from it. I am someone who can succeed individually but soar with a team. We may need to break some bad habits, but that is OK! Just ask my wife...she still loves me after 13 years, you will too.

_I want to learn from the best_.  I understand that to be successful, learning never stops, and I still have a lot to learn! I want to come to the table with humility, humor, and energy to learn from the best and do my life’s best work.

## Why love you?

You build products that people like myself love to use. You are obsessed with design. You sweat the details. You take good care of your people. Only the best of the best work for you because you push boundaries and challenge the status quo.

I guess you could say I have had a crush on you for years. 😍 Your philosophy for building software and love for design is what fueled my passion for creating digital products. I have used Stripe for many personal and professional projects because I was blown away by how easy Stripe made it to accept payments. I know I can learn a lot at Stipe and do my best work. I want to unlock my full potential and learn from the best.

## Even the Exes still like me

> I spent years building a solid team of design generalists. Through the process I learned how rare it is to find someone who can truly do it all. Jon is one of the few. He has an intuitive sense of usability and aesthetics, the technical skill to realize his designs, and the tools to test and iterate. Crucially, all of this comes with no ego and with a drive to learn and improve. <cite>—Jeremy Dunsworth, Learning Objects</cite>

> Jon is a great communicator. He leads by listening and teasing out underlying UX issues. In a recent engagement, Jon guided our team through a very productive design cycle. We produced a working prototype and simplified our design processes. <cite>—Ant Addis, Aspire Ability</cite>

> I had the pleasure of working with Jon on a smartphone app project over a period of several months.  He was intuitive and was adept at taking my vision from something that existed as much in my mind as it did on paper.  Jon was responsive during the ongoing creation and beta testing of the project and brought several good ideas to the table.  The final result exceeded my expectations. <cite>—Craig Hricz, EKG DDX</cite>

### Let’s make it official

Stripe has been inspiring me for years to think outside the box and challenge myself as a professional. The expectations are high, the bar is set even higher. I’m not going to lie, I’m a little intimidated. You are worth it, and frankly, I think I am worth it too. We’re going to make beautiful ~~babies~~ products together.

So what do you say, are we a [match](#intro)?
