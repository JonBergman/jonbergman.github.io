I’m Jon, a multi-disciplined product designer that is passionate about building an inclusive web. There couldn’t be a better time to join Stripe. Accepting payments online has become essential for businesses to keep their doors open. That is why I would love to join Stripe as a Product Designer. To work with amazing people to build beautiful products that make online payments accessible to everyone.

## Why love me?

_I am a designer who can code_. I have intentionally focused on becoming a generalist because I find delight in all aspects of the product development process. I take pride in using [both sides of my brain](https://www.healthline.com/health/left-brain-vs-right-brain#left-brainright-brain-theory), often wearing many different hats. More specifically, I enjoy applying a [Lean UX](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/a-simple-introduction-to-lean-ux) process to ideate, test, and validate ideas. Then, I use my knowledge of software engineering to build [accessible](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/), scalable, and beautiful design systems with code.

_I am self-motivated_. I ask hard questions, and with determination, find the answers. If I make a mistake-I own it, fix it, and grow from it. I am someone who can succeed individually but soar with a team. We may need to break some bad habits, but that is OK! I strive to be honest and work with integrity because the best teams are built on trust and respect.

_I want to learn from the best_. I understand that to be successful, learning never stops, and I still have a lot to learn! Stripe has an incredible team with diverse backgrounds and experiences. I want to come to that table with humility, humor, and energy to learn from the best and do my life’s best work with Stripe.

## Why love you?

Stripe is pushing boundaries to make the web a better place. You are obsessed with design. You make products that both developers and business owners love to use. You sweat the details. You take good care of your people. You care about making inclusive products that people with disabilities can use. You are actively expanding economic access across the world which improves people’s lives.

> I spent years building a solid team of design generalists. Through the process I learned how rare it is to find someone who can truly do it all. Jon is one of the few. He has an intuitive sense of usability and aesthetics, the technical skill to realize his designs, and the tools to test and iterate. Crucially, all of this comes with no ego and with a drive to learn and improve. <cite>—Jeremy Dunsworth, Learning Objects</cite>

> Jon is a great communicator. He leads by listening and teasing out underlying UX issues. In a recent engagement, Jon guided our team through a very productive design cycle. We produced a working prototype and simplified our design processes. <cite>—Ant Addis, Aspire Ability</cite>

> I had the pleasure of working with Jon on a smartphone app project over a period of several months.  He was intuitive and was adept at taking my vision from something that existed as much in my mind as it did on paper.  Jon was responsive during the ongoing creation and beta testing of the project and brought several good ideas to the table.  The final result exceeded my expectations. <cite>—Craig Hricz, EKG DDX</cite>

### Let’s get in touch

Stripe has been inspiring me for years to think outside the box and challenge myself as a professional. The expectations are high, the bar is set even higher. I’m not going to lie, I’m a little intimidated. You are worth it, and frankly, I think I am worth it too. We’re going to make beautiful products together.
