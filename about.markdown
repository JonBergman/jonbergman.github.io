Iâ€™m Jon, a designer that can bring beautiful ideas to life with code. My guilty pleasure is deleting code. I am inspired by my faith and family to be the best man I can be and do exceptional work.

### What I do

I help organizations large and small build engaging products through design-driven product development, UX design, and full-stack software engineering.

More specifically I use a Lean UX process to validate ideas. I translate those ideas into wireframes and prototypes to gather user data in order to make informed decisions. Then I use my experience in software engineering to build scalable and maintainable design pattern libraries with code. 

### Extra

I live in New Hampshire with my beautiful wife and three children. We are also foster parents and deeply desire to help vulnerable children and their families heal and be restored.

When I am not learning a [new skill](https://masterclass.com) or building things with my hands, [music](https://soundcloud.com/jon-bergman) is my primary creative outlet. I also enjoy the outdoors, travel, trading card games, reading books, video games, art, and sports.
