Hello! My name is Jon, I am a <strong>product designer</strong> and <strong>technologist</strong> from New Hampshire. I have over 10 years of experience designing and building elegant and accessible products for the web. Nice to meet you!

When I am not learning a new skill or building things with my hands, [music](https://soundcloud.com/jon-bergman) is my primary creative outlet. I also enjoy the outdoors, travel, trading card games, reading books, video games, art, and sports. We are also a foster family and deeply desire to see the next generation and their families be restored.

If you would like to collaborate or just say hi please [get in touch](mailto:jonmb08@gmail.com?Subject=Hello!). I would love to learn more about you. You can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jmbergman) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonmbergman/). Cheers!

		<h3>1. Investigation</h3>
		<p>The goal is to find the cause-and-effect relationships underlying any particular problem.. From there it’s important to identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and competitive threats because business problems are design opportunities. Once we have done our analysis we can use what we have discovered to form a hypothesis.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="col">
		<h3>2. Ideation</h3>
		<p>With our hypothesis in mind we can start to rapidly brainstorm potential solutions. Collaborating closely with stakeholders we will gather a large range of ideas. I like to use rapid idea generation activities such as sticky notes, speed sketching, and lightning demos. From these sessions we will identify common themes and pick a solution we want to test.</p>
	</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col">
		<h3>3. Validation</h3>
		<p>Testing our solution with real people will provide invaluable data for our hypothesis. We will build prototypes with fidelity according to the complexity of the solution. This could mean a real user interface or just a sketch on a piece of paper. Based on this feedback, we will either feel confident our solution will solve the problem or that we need to take what we have learned and ideate again.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="col">
		<h3>4. Implementation</h3>
		<p>When we are confident that our solution will solve the problem it’s time to turn our vision into reality with code. This could look like close collaboration with engineers during a product development process. We should also look at implementation holistically and consider using design systems, styles guides, and pattern libraries to scale the design process. This empowers teams to deliver consistent and elegant experiences with less design oversight.</p>

### What others say about me

> I spent years building a solid team of design generalists. Through the process I learned how rare it is to find someone who can truly do it all. Jon is one of the few. He has an intuitive sense of usability and aesthetics, the technical skill to realize his designs, and the tools to test and iterate. Crucially, all of this comes with no ego and with a drive to learn and improve.

> Jon is a great communicator. He leads by listening and teasing out underlying UX issues. In a recent engagement, Jon guided our team through a very productive design cycle. We produced a working prototype and simplified our design processes.

>I had the pleasure of working with Jon on a smartphone app project over a period of several months.  He was intuitive and was adept at taking my vision from something that existed as much in my mind as it did on paper.  Jon was responsive during the ongoing creation and beta testing of the project and brought several good ideas to the table.  The final result exceeded my expectations.
