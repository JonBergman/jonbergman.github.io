At [Learning Objects](https://www.cengage.com) we were building a competency based learning platform for students, educators, and instructional designers. The challenge was that we had limited designers supporting multiple product teams without a centralized way to build our user interfaces or have established process or  principles to guide design direction. This seperation led to a segregation of visual design and user experiences.

My role:

* UX
* Strategy
* Product Design

### The Pitch

### Starting with the principles
We needed a way to centralize our design direction and establish guidelines for reviews. This is where principles can shine. The team worked together to create 

### Creating an inventory
Since we had products teams working independantly for a number of years it was important to take inventory of what components and patterns are unique or could be shared. We found lot's of redundancy of UI elements and common patterns providing different experiences.


### Barrowing from the best
We realized that building a design system can be extremely resource intensive. In order to successful we needed to find a way to deliver
### Adoption is king


### Outcome
All three of our product teams were able to adopt and use the design system components regardless of the their technology stack. Design intent was more clearly communicated and the engineers were able to rapidly develop and test user interfaces. Our product experiences became more consistent and the teams became more efficient. This was definitely one of my proudest moments and I am thankful for the teams and the leadership for putting their faith in me and this project.
