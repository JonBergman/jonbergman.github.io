At [FlatWorld](https://www.cengage.com) we are building a competency based learning platform for students, educators, and instructional designers. The challenge was that we had limited designers supporting multiple product teams without a centralized way to build our user interfaces or have established process or  principles to guide design direction. This seperation led to a segregation of visual design and user experiences.
