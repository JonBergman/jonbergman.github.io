## Overview

<a href="https://www.libertymutual.com/" target="_blank">Liberty Mutual</a> is one of the world's leading insurance organizations. I was a part of the eCommerce team building the web and mobile applications used by our customers to manage their policies, billing, and claims.

The majority of my time was dedicated to developing features for the Liberty Mutual mobile application. The app is currently rated 4.8 out of 5 stars from 336.9K ratings on the App store.

### Wayfinder

The feature I am most proud of building at Liberty was the Wayfinder. This feature provided the customer with context on their claims process and also provided navigation between the various stages.

### Claims

We also build the entire process for submitting claims through the mobile application. This enabled our customers to take pictures and file incident claims from any location.

## Learning

This was my first full-time software development job. I learned a ton about JavaScript frameworks, stretched my knowledge of CSS, and was introduced to the Agile software development process.
