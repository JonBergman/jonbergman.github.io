## Overview

As the Product Design Lead at <a href="https://www.salesimpact.io/" target="_blank">Sales Impact Academy (SIA)</a>, I undertook the challenge of redesigning and enhancing the sales training platform to deliver an unparalleled learning experience for sales professionals. The project aimed to create a comprehensive and user-friendly platform with features such as course discovery, user tasks, live coaching, and asynchronous coach feedback. Leveraging Lean UX principles, I led a cross-functional team through a series of quick iterations to achieve exceptional results.

## The Problem 

The previous platform at SIA lacked a cohesive user experience and struggled to keep pace with the evolving needs of the target customer. Users faced difficulties in discovering relevant courses, lacked personalized learning paths, and had limited access to coaching and feedback. The platform's outdated design and usability issues contributed to low user engagement and limited success. We saw high churn and sales drop dramatically after the bubble burst in 2022 and we quickly realized our product was a nice-to-have rather than a must have.

## Solution

To address the challenges faced by SIA with their existing sales training catalog, we proposed a comprehensive redevelopment of our platform and learning experience that focuses on concise 30-minute sessions on specific skills. The new platform will incorporate personalized learning paths, interactive live coaching, and efficient synchronous and asynchronous coach feedback to drive engagement and attendance.

## User Research

We leveraged our existing customers as well as internal GTM team members to develop personas and ideal customer profiles (ICP) we would target. We utilized surveys, focus groups, and multiple design thinking sessions such as <a href="http://www.gv.com/sprint/" target="_blank">design sprints</a> to brainstorms potential solutions to for our customers. This helped me gain insights into the customer's pain points, expectations, and desired features. I also analyzed user behavior data from the existing platform to identify usage patterns and areas for improvement in the user experience.

## Course Discovery

Based on user feedback and industry best practices, I implemented a robust course discovery system. Users could now easily filter and search for relevant courses based on their role, live sessions, and specific topics based on text.

## User Tasks

To enhance user engagement and progression, I introduced a personalized task management feature. The users home screen would list the next required tasks based on their course progress. This ensured the user knew what to do and when. When all tasks are complete the user recieved a joyful cheer!

## Live Coaching

To facilitate interactive learning, I integrated live coaching sessions into the platform. Sales professionals could now join virtual coaching sessions with industry experts, participating in role-playing scenarios and receiving real-time feedback.

Managers could also discover upcoming sessions from a dedicated page and enroll their team.

## Async Coach Feedback

Recognizing the need for continuous improvement, I introduced asynchronous coach feedback. Users could submit recorded sales pitches or interactions for review and receive personalized feedback from their coaches.

## Unified Design System

I established a design system in Figma to ensure a consistent user interface and experience across all platform features. This system enabled the design and development teams to work efficiently, promoting design scalability. We used <a href="https://chakra-ui.com/" target="_blank">ChakraUI</a> as the front-end framework and themed the components to match our existing brand.

## Results

The redesigned sales training platform achieved remarkable results and significantly impacted SIA's ability to scale their new product offering. User satisfaction surveys indicated a 80% approval rating for the platform's new product, design, and features, highlighting the positive impact on user experience.

## Conclusion

By adopting a user-centered design approach and applying Lean UX principles, the redesign of Sales Impact Academy's sales training platform proved to be a game-changer. The seamless integration of course discovery, user tasks, live coaching, and asynchronous feedback resulted in improved user engagement and performance. The success of this project demonstrated the significance of continuous improvement and quick iterations in creating a product that truly meets the needs of its users. The possibilities of what's next are endless...
