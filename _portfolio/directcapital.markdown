## Overview

<a href="https://www.cit.com/business" target="_blank">Direct Capital</a> (Purchased by <a href="https://www.cit.com/" target="_blank">CIT</a> in 2014.) provides financial solutions for small to medium sized businesses including equipment financing and working capital programs. My role as the senior web developer was to redesign legacy applications and create new platform features using the new brand.

### Homepage

I developed the marketing website using responsive design and architected the homepage quote tool which contributed to 7 million in new business within 6 months.

### Customer Portal

Responsively designed portal for customers to manage their small business financing on any device. Customers could request a quote, see their pending financing requests, track status, and manage their account.

## Learnings

I learned a ton about Microsoft's developer ecosystem, visual studio, C#, and new JavaScript frameworks. I also continued to grow in my love for CSS and responsive design. I also learned the importance of understanding your worth and to not let others bring you down.
