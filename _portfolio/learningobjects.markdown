## Overview
As the Senior Product Designer at <a href="https://learningobjects.com/" target="_blank">Learning Objects</a> (Aquired by <a href="https://www.cengagegroup.com/" target="_blank">Cengage</a>), I spearheaded the design and development of groundbreaking educational solutions, including the competency-based education platform and content authoring tool. Additionally, I took the initiative to pitch, create, and design the accessible Learning Objects (LO) design system and front-end framework. Through my efforts, I aimed to empower educators and learners with cutting-edge technology that fosters personalized and accessible learning experiences.

## Problem

Learning Objects faced a growing demand for modernizing education by embracing competency-based learning. The existing systems were outdated and did not provide educators with the tools to create and deliver personalized content effectively. Accessibility was required by law, as learners with diverse needs required inclusive and adaptable learning experiences.

## Research
To understand the needs of all of our personas including educators, learners, and program managers, the team conducted in-depth user research, interviews, and workshops. We even filled an entire wall in our office with sticky notes. We worked closely with instructional designers, educators, and students to gather insights into their pain points, expectations, and aspirations. We used this research to create hypothesis and tested prototypes with our customers.

## Competency-Based Education Platform

The team designed a learner-centric platform that supported competency-based education. The platform allowed educators to design personalized learning paths, assess competency mastery, and provide timely feedback to learners.

We also created a dashboad for the educators. This screen displays what grades are needed, latest discussion posts, and alerts for when students are stuggling to master a particular competency.

## Grading

Competency based education is graded based on understanding. Instead of a grade point system, instructors evaluate evidence against a rubric and provide feedback. We designed a way for instructors to do this rapidly and called it 'speed grader'.

Here is what the assignment screen looked like. Clearly displaying the prompt, expectations, and how you will be graded.

## Content Authoring Tool

Recognizing the importance of empowering educators, we also created an intuitive content authoring tool. It enabled educators and learning designers to create interactive and adaptive content, aligning with competency frameworks, and seamlessly integrate multimedia elements.

## Accessible LO Design System

To prioritize accessibility and inclusivity, I pitched the concept of the Learning Objects design system. I crafted a comprehensive, accessible design language that adhered to WCAG 2.0 guidelines, ensuring that learners with disabilities could engage fully with the platform.

## Front-end Framework

To enhance efficiency and consistency across product development, I developed the front-end framework based on the LO design system. The framework facilitated the creation of accessible user interfaces, while ensuring seamless integration with the competency-based education platform and content authoring tool. This helped us bring the experiences closer together and rapidly increase our development of UI's. The framework was composed of customized <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> and <a href="https://angular.io/" target="_blank">Angular</a> components that we themed using design tokens.

## Results

**Empowered Educators** The competency-based education platform and content authoring tool empowered educators to create personalized learning experiences, improving student engagement and success.

**Inclusive Learning** The accessible LO design system and front-end framework ensured that learners of all abilities could access and navigate the platform effortlessly, creating a more inclusive learning environment.

**Industry Recognition** Learning Objects received industry recognition for its innovation in competency-based education and commitment to accessibility, earning praise from educational institutions and organizations such as <a href="https://www.asu.edu/" target="_blank">Arizona State University</a>.

## Conclusion

As the Senior Product Designer at Learning Objects, my work in designing and developing the competency-based education platform, content authoring tool, and the accessible LO design system and front-end framework has had a profound impact on the education landscape. By prioritizing learner-centric experiences and inclusivity, Learning Objects has revolutionized education, empowering educators to deliver personalized learning journeys to students of all abilities. The success of these initiatives showcases the power of human-centered design and innovation in shaping the future of education.
