## Overview

<a href="https://www.storylinellc.com" target="_blank">Storyline LLC</a> is a customer experience shop that delivers insights to organizations based on customer feedback. I spearheaded the design and development of a platform aimed at streamlining the manual Storyline LLC process of interviewing and collecting customer feedback and transforming that data into insights. The platform enabled effortless creation and organization of participants, assignment of demographics, and seamless printing of quote cards. Leveraging Ruby on Rails, I ensured the application was not only feature-rich but also designed responsively to provide a seamless user experience across all screen sizes.

## Problem

Before the development of the platform, Storyline LLC faced significant challenges in efficiently managing participant quotes. The process was cumbersome and lacked a centralized system to store and categorize quotes. Manually creating and printing quotes was time-consuming and hampered the team's efforts to scale production. The customer deliverables were 100% on paper and presented during a walkthrough. Customers desired to view their insights in the future in a digital way.
