I’m Jon, a multi-disciplined creative that is passionate about building an inclusive web. Pendo is helping organizations become product-led and ship experiences that customers love. That is why I would love to join Pendo as Product Designer. To build intuitive and elegant experiences that in turn help others deliver amazing experiences for their customers.

## Why me?

<image src="/assets/images/but-why.gif" alt="But Why?" class="right"/>

_I can solve complex business problems_. I have many years of [relevant experience](/resume) designing and building products but what really lights my fire is solving complex business problems that increase an organization’s efficiency, effectiveness, and return on investment. This could be calculating the ROI of design, or scaling design through design systems, or using a [lean](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/a-simple-introduction-to-lean-ux) technique to ideate, test, and validate ideas.

_I am a team player_. I ask hard questions, and with determination, find the answers. If I make a mistake-I own it, fix it, and grow from it. I am someone who can succeed individually but soar with a team. We may need to break some bad habits, but that is OK! I strive to be honest and work with integrity because the best teams are built on trust and respect.

_I want to keep learning_. I understand that to be successful, learning never stops, and I still have a lot to learn! I know Pendo will provide a culture where I can learn from a diverse group of amazing designers. I want to come to the table with humility, humor, and energy to learn from the best and do my life’s best work with Pendo.

## Why love you?

You are building product-led tools that help organizations deliver amazing experiences. You have a deep respect for diversity and value the views of individuals. You take good care of your people. You attract top-notch talent because you push boundaries and challenge the status quo. I know I can thrive with this team and push the boundaries of what Pendo can accomplish.

## What people say about me

> I spent years building a solid team of design generalists. Through the process I learned how rare it is to find someone who can truly do it all. Jon is one of the few. He has an intuitive sense of usability and aesthetics, the technical skill to realize his designs, and the tools to test and iterate. Crucially, all of this comes with no ego and with a drive to learn and improve. <cite>—Jeremy Dunsworth, Learning Objects</cite>

> Jon is a great communicator. He leads by listening and teasing out underlying UX issues. In a recent engagement, Jon guided our team through a very productive design cycle. We produced a working prototype and simplified our design processes. <cite>—Ant Addis, Aspire Ability</cite>

> I had the pleasure of working with Jon on a smartphone app project over a period of several months.  He was intuitive and was adept at taking my vision from something that existed as much in my mind as it did on paper.  Jon was responsive during the ongoing creation and beta testing of the project and brought several good ideas to the table.  The final result exceeded my expectations. <cite>—Craig Hricz, EKG DDX</cite>

### Let’s get in touch

I know we can accomplish some amazing things together. The expectations are high, but I am up for the challenge. You are worth it, and I think I am worth it too. I would love an opportunity to engage more and answer any questions you may have. I look forward to speaking with you.
