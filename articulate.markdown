I’m Jon, a multi-disciplined creative that is passionate about building an inclusive web. There couldn’t be a better time to join a company that pushes the boundaries of online learning. That is why I would love to join Articulate as Product Designer. To build an inclusive and accessible space for people to learn in the new normal.

## Why love me?

<image src="/assets/images/but-why.gif" alt="But Why?" class="right"/>

_I can solve complex business problems_. I have many years of [relevant experience](/resume) designing and building products as an individual contributor but what really lights my fire is solving complex business problems that increase an organization’s efficiency, effectiveness, and return on investment. This could be calculating the ROI of design, or scaling a design system across many product teams, or using a new technique like [Lean UX](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/a-simple-introduction-to-lean-ux) to ideate, test, and validate ideas.

_I am a team player_. I ask hard questions, and with determination, find the answers. If I make a mistake-I own it, fix it, and grow from it. I am someone who can succeed individually but soar with a team. We may need to break some bad habits, but that is OK! I strive to be honest and work with integrity because the best teams are built on trust and respect.

_I want to make an impact_.  I understand that to be successful, learning never stops, and I still have a lot to learn! I want to come to the table with humility, humor, and energy to learn from the best and do my life’s best work with Articulate.

## Even the Exes still like me

> I spent years building a solid team of design generalists. Through the process I learned how rare it is to find someone who can truly do it all. Jon is one of the few. He has an intuitive sense of usability and aesthetics, the technical skill to realize his designs, and the tools to test and iterate. Crucially, all of this comes with no ego and with a drive to learn and improve. <cite>—Jeremy Dunsworth, Learning Objects</cite>

> Jon is a great communicator. He leads by listening and teasing out underlying UX issues. In a recent engagement, Jon guided our team through a very productive design cycle. We produced a working prototype and simplified our design processes. <cite>—Ant Addis, Aspire Ability</cite>

> I had the pleasure of working with Jon on a smartphone app project over a period of several months.  He was intuitive and was adept at taking my vision from something that existed as much in my mind as it did on paper.  Jon was responsive during the ongoing creation and beta testing of the project and brought several good ideas to the table.  The final result exceeded my expectations. <cite>—Craig Hricz, EKG DDX</cite>

### Let’s make it official

Articulate has been inspiring me for years in the way I design engaging learning experiences. The expectations are high, but I am up for the challenge. You are worth it, and frankly, I think I am worth it too. We’re going to make beautiful ~~babies~~ products together.

So what do you say, are we a [match](#intro)?
