I joined [FlatWorld](https://flatworld.com) in January of 2017 as a Senior Software Engineer. FlatWorld is a small independent publisher of higher education textbooks. In addition to paper books, FlatWorld provides online access to their books starting as low as $24.95.

Engineers at FlatWorld build and maintain many different platforms, products, and services. Most applications have unique tech stacks, so there is always something new to learn.

Since joining I have been able to audit and fix many accessibility issues in our applications. I also helped write our company VPAT.

I also have opportunities to pitch user experience improvements. Here are some of the designs I personally worked on.
