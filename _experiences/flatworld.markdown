I joined [FlatWorld](https://flatworld.com) in January of 2017 as a Senior Software Engineer. FlatWorld is a small independent publisher of higher education textbooks. In addition to paper books, FlatWorld provides online access to their books starting as low as $24.95.

Engineers at FlatWorld build and maintain many different platforms, products, and services. Most applications have unique tech stacks, so there is always something new to learn.

One of my primary responsibilities is to audit and fix accessibility issues. I also write our company VPAT.

In addition to engineering I often pitch user experience improvements. Here are some of the designs I personally worked on.
