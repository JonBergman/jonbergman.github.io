[FlatWorld](https://flatworld.com) is a small independent publisher of higher education textbooks. In addition to paper books, FlatWorld provides online access to their books starting as low as $24.95.

Engineers at FlatWorld build and maintain many different platforms, products, and services. This gives us the ability to wear many different hats. Most applications have unique tech stacks, so there is always something new to learn.

Since FlatWorld provides educational content and services to higher educational institutions we are required to follow [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/) compliance for all of our products. My responsibility is to drive accessible first design when we ship new capabilities. This motivates us to sweat the details. The end result are experiences that are semantic, accessible, and visually appealing.
