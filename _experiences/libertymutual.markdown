Liberty Mutual was my first formal Software Developer job. While there i had the opportunity to work on their eCommerce team that developed the customer portal and mobile applications. I even had the opportunity to travel to Belfast Ireland to work closely with our team overseas. 

My favorite experience at Liberty was working on the Liberty Mutual mobile application. The mobile app was built with PhoneGap and a homegrown Single Page Application framework that used the Dojo Toolkit.
