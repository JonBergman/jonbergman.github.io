[Liberty Mutual](https://libertymutual.com) was my first formal Software Developer job. While there, I had the opportunity to work on the eCommerce team to develop the customer portal and mobile applications.

My favorite experience at Liberty was working on the Liberty Mutual mobile application. The mobile app was built with PhoneGap and a homegrown Single Page Application framework that used the Dojo Toolkit.
