[CIT](https://cit.com) (Direct Capital at the time) provided financing to small businesses for equipment purchases.

While at CIT I had the opportunity to redesign their legacy user portal to match their existing style guide. This required a complete rewrite of the project CSS.

My favorite project was leading a complete website redesign and build. The most challenging part of the project was building a quote widget on the homepage that could accurately estimate a customerâ€™s monthly payment.
