I joined [CIT](https://cit.com) (Direct Capital at the time) as a Web Developer in September of 2013. Direct Capital provided financing to small businesses for equipment purchases.

Our engineering team was responsible for all of the organization's web technology.

My first project was to redesign their legacy user portal to match their existing style guide. This required a complete rewrite of the project CSS.

My favorite project was leading a complete website redesign and build. The most challenging part of the project was building a quote widget on the homepage that could accurately estimate a customerâ€™s monthly payment.
