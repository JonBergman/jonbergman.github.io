I joined [CIT](https://cit.com) (Direct Capital at the time) as a Web Developer in September of 2013. Direct Capital core business was providing financing to small business. For example, if a Wendy's franchise required a new deep fryer they could come to us for financing of their equipment purchase.

This was a big environment shift from the large corporate organizations I had worked for since my college education. I would be working with a small scrappy engineering team that was responsible for all of the organizations web technology. It was a lot of pressure but I was excited to break out of the bureaucracy.

My first project was to redesign their legacy user portal to match their existing style guide. This required a complete rewrite of the project CSS but I was up for the challenge.

From there I was able to work on their customer intake program.

I was also the lead on a complete website build and redesign. I'm most proud of the quick quote form on the homepage. Financing prices were changing all the time so we pulled rates once a week from our sales platform. Based on the users input of how many funds they required and what kind of financing they were looking for we could acurately estimate the monthly payment.
