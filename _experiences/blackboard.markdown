I joined [Blackboard](https://blackboard.com) as a Senior UI Designer in 2015. Our small team of designers worked closely with agile software development teams to build the [next generation](https://help.blackboard.com/Learn/Instructor/Getting_Started/What_Is_Ultra) of online learning products. 

We were rebuilding and redesigning most of our products with a new style guide called New School. I was responsible for building New School components with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The UI designers were also responsible for the applicationâ€™s accessibility. This was my introduction to the world of WCAG standards.
