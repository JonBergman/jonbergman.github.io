I joined [Blackboard](https://blackboard.com) as a Senior UI Designer in 2015. Our small team of designers worked closely with agile software development teams to build the [next generation](https://help.blackboard.com/Learn/Instructor/Getting_Started/What_Is_Ultra) of online learning products.

I was assigned to Blackboard’s flagship LMS product, Learn where I helped resolve design bugs, accessibility enhancements, and interaction design. We we’re rebuilding and redesigning most of our products with a new Style Guide called New School.

Rethinking our CSS architecture to reduce bugs and reduce maintenance strain was the work I enjoyed the most while at Blackboard. 

Although this was a breif gig I made some good friends and learned some valuable lessons in communication, setting expectations, and patience. That really set me up for success for what was [next](/experiences/cengage).
