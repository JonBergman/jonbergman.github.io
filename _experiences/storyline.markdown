[Storyline LLC](https://www.storylinellc.com/) is a small independent design firm that "connect companies with their customers in meaningful ways and generate insight that is actionable with design thinking."

Their process requires collecting a large amount of data via in-person recorded user interviews. These scripts are parsed, tagged, and categorized using their design thinking framework and presented to customers during a walk-through. 

This process was all done on paper. The audio was transcribed using powerpoint and printed on paper for sorting. There was not a great way to share, store, or search the data.

I was hired to create an online application that would allow Storyline to perform their whole process online. This was going to be a tough challenge but I was up to it.
