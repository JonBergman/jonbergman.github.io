[Storyline LLC](https://www.storylinellc.com/) is a small independent design firm that "connect companies with their customers in meaningful ways and generate insight that is actionable with design thinking."

Their process requires collecting a large amount of data via in-person recorded user interviews. These scripts are parsed, tagged, and categorized using their design thinking framework and presented to customers during a walk-through. 

The problem was this process was all done on paper, each peice of data was transcribed using powerpoint and printed for sorting. There was not a great way to share, store, or search the data once it was transcribed.

I was hired to create an online application that would allow them to perform their whole process of transcribing online. This was going to be a tough challenge but I was up to it.

I decided to build the application using Ruby on Rails and hosted in Heroku to make the delivery as seemless as possible. In my opinion, Heroku + Rails has been the most steamlined application delivery and hosting process I have ever used.
