[Storyline LLC](https://www.storylinellc.com/) is a small independent design firm that “connects companies with their customers in meaningful ways and generates insight that is actionable with design thinking.”

Their process requires collecting a large amount of data via in-person recorded user interviews. These scripts are parsed, tagged, and categorized using their design thinking framework and presented to customers during a walk-through.

All data collection was still being done on paper! The audio was transcribed using powerpoint and printed on paper for sorting. This was not a sustainable way to share, store, or search the data.

I was hired to create an online application that would allow Storyline to perform their whole process online.
