[Cengage](https://cengage.com) is one of the largest education publishers in world. While at Cengage, I had the opportunity to help build a competency based (CBE) platform for higher education institutions.

My responsibility as a Lead Product Designer was to provide the design direction, assets, documentation and front-end code for the CBE platform and our curriculum authoring tool.

The work I enjoyed the most was testing, building, and pitching the idea of a centralized design system that developers could consume across all projects. The goal was to scale design across many product teams in order to provide the most consistent and delightful experiences. With only a few full-time design staff our resources were stretched thin. We did not have the ability to design our own system from scratch, so we had to be pragmatic, barrow ideas when necessary, and not reinvent the wheel. The solution was to customize an existing front-end framework like [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com), only adding what we needed for our specific use cases and tweaking it just enough to feel like our own. The result was a shared design framework that developers could import into their projects. This framework made our product design more seamless and while increasing our velocity of shipping beautiful and accessible experiences.
