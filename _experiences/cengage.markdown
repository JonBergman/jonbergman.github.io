I joined [Cengage](https://cengage.com) as a Senior Product Designer in November of 2015. The team I was joining was called [Learning Objects](https://learningobjects.com) from Washington D.C. Learning Objects was building a competency based platform for higher education institutions.

My responsibility as Product Designer was to work on product teams building our core competency based education experience for students and instructors and also our custom CMS for building competency based curriculum.

This was my first experience with a team that profoundly believed in providing a work culture that attracted, retained, and invested in their talent. Many people I worked with at Learning Objects I consider friends, and continue to keep in contact with.

The work I was most proud of at Learning Objects was testing, building, and pitching the idea of a centralized design system that developers could use for all products across the organization.

Scaling design process and collaboration with tools like Craft

Education on CSS frameworks and style guides

* Scaled design across all Learning Objects products by building a centralized Front-End framework.
* Introduced design tools and process to communicate, test, and validate ideas.
* Created a centralized library of components for designers to use in Sketch.
* Responsible for the product design of the content authoring and competency based learning platforms.
* Raised the organizations CSS knowledge by providing education through through presentations and workshops.
