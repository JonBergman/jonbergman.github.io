[FreddieMac](http://www.freddiemac.com/) was my first "big boy" job right out of college. They had an amazing college recruitment program. I joined with a class of about 30 peers, all recent graduates. We quickly became friends as we went through cooporate trainings, lectures, and workshops. 

This was a rotational program where we were able to test out multiple business units within the organization for 3 months each. My first placement was on a QA team running tests for a multi-dimentional data store. I remember the sheer scale of the project blowing my mind. Millions of dollars in personel, technology, hardware, you name it. The team consisted of mostly Hindi women which I absolutely loved working with. They were very nice to me and I was often spoiled with delicous Indian food at team lunches. During this placement I learned how to use large test automation software and write very technical documentation.

I could have seen myself staying at FreddieMac for a few years, but a very special person stole my heart and moved to New Hampshire. I am very thankful to FreddieMac for getting me started on my jouney and will not forget the relationships I made and the skills I learned there.
