[FreddieMac](http://www.freddiemac.com/) was my first “big boy” job right out of college. They had an amazing  rotational program for recent college graduates Every 3 months I was able to test out a different business unit. My first placement was on a QA team running tests for a multi-dimensional data store. During this placement I learned how to use large test automation software and write technical documentation.

I could have seen myself staying at FreddieMac for a few years, but a very special person stole my heart and I moved to New Hampshire. I am very thankful to FreddieMac for getting me started on my journey.
